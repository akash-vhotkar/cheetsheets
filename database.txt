Difference between views and materialize views

views store query expression and does not store table 
whenever we hit the view  engine will execute the query generate the table on the fly Hence we get the latest data 
views is slow in terms of complex data 
views should be used when we have small query and unfrequet query 
Views are used when data is to be accessed infrequently and the data in a table gets updated on a frequent basis.
views is also called dynamic view 

In materialized view  they store query expressions and table on the disk 
Materialized Views are used when data is to be accessed frequently and data in the table not get updated on a frequent basis.
Whenever we call materialize view it  having precomputed data it will just give that data do not execute the query 
in material  view data needs to updated manually or using triggers etc 
Materialize view is fast as compared to the views
materialize view is also called static view
