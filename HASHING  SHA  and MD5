Hashing is the technique in which  we are generating hash value from  string using hash algorithms 
 

In the hashing algorithms we cannot decrypt the hash value we just  comare the value at time of the checking 
Example 
Suppose we are enter password Abcd@123  = hash value  = 234324
For cheking again enter password Abcd@123  = hash  value  = 234324
So in these we never decrypt the hash value we just compare hash value


Message digest  5 algorithm 
Which will give  128 fixed length hash value  
The MD5 (message-digest algorithm) hashing algorithm is a one-way cryptographic function that accepts a message of any length as input and returns as output a fixed-length digest value to be used for authenticating the original message.


SHA  = secure hash algorithem 
Has two categories  such 
SHA1 = secure hash algorithm 1 which will generate  160 characters long  hash value 
SHA2 = secure hash algorithem  2 which have family of algorithem 
SHA256 , SHA224 etc

SHA256 
Which is generate  256 characters long hash value from given string 

SHA224 
Which is generate  224 characters long hash value from given string 


SHA-1 is a 160-bit (20 byte) hash that is represented by a 40-digit hexadecimal string of numbers.
 SHA-2, on the other hand, is a family of six different hash functions that generate hash values of varying lengths â€” 224, 256, 384, or 512 bits
